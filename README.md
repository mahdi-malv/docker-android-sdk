# Docker Android SDK container

Made this image to be able to run CI testing with **Android studio Arctic Fox**.  
This version of Android studio requires **Java 11** that does not exists in many docker images I've found

## Contains
- Android API 30
- Java JDK 11

## Usage

```
docker pull mahdimalv/android-sdk:api30-jdk11
```
